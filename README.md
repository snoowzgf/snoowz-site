# 🌐 snoowzgf.github.io

Hi! I'm **Snoowz**, and this is my official website.

I built this site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a clean, animated layout, a custom Discord invite card, a typing effect, and a dynamic background — all hosted on GitHub Pages.

## 🎯 Purpose

This site is a personal space to showcase my world, my community, and what I enjoy creating on the web.  
It’s also a way for me to improve my front-end skills and share something that feels like *me*.

## 💡 Want to reuse it?

Feel free to **use or modify this site** for your own project — I’m totally okay with that!  
Just **please give me credit** by mentioning that the original version was made by me:

> `Original site created by Snoowz – https://github.com/snoowzgf`

That’s all I ask — don’t pretend it’s fully yours, and we’re cool 🙏

> 📌 I built this with love and attention to detail. Have fun exploring or building on it!
